Welcome! 

Here's a link to the hosted website: https://shoppies-895cb.web.app

To use the site, simply search for a movie in the search-field at the top of the website. Once the API has narrowed down some titles based on your search query, they will appear in the main "Search Results" block. You can view a short plot summary of each movie by clicking the drop down arrow on each movie card, and add the movie to your nomination list by clicking the "Nominate this Movie" button. To view your current nominees, click on the "Show Nominations" button located on the navbar. Nominees can also be deleted from the Nomination list by clicking on the "Delete Nomination" button. Once your list has 5 nominations, you're set! 

Have fun
